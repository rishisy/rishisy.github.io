    <h3>1 . Karuizawa</h3>

    <p1>Karuizawa is a charming resort town tucked beneath the imposing Mt. Asama, one of Honshū’s most active volcanoes. It’s a popular day trip from Tokyo – an hour away by high-speed train – for hiking and visiting hot springs and Yacho-no-mori (Wild Bird Forest), which is home to over 60 different bird species.</p1>

    <p1>Head to Sendai – around 90 minutes from Tokyo by train – for beautiful cherry blossom scenes in the spring. This coastal metropolis is nicknamed the ‘City of Trees’ for its abundance of green spaces – Tsutsujigaoka Park is one of the best cherry blossom viewing spots with more than 360 trees.</p1>

    <h3>4 . Shirakawa-go</h3>
    <p1>This remote village, a Unesco World Heritage site, looks like something out of a fairytale, with thatched Gassho-style houses surrounded by mountainous landscapes. These houses are traditional farm buildings, which were built between the 17th century and the beginning of the 20th century.</p1>
